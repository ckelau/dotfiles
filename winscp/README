The following was taken from

http://winscp.net/eng/docs/config

To export
1. Session > Sites > Site Manager
2. Tools > Export/Backup configuration
3. Save the configuration

To import
1. Session > Sites > Site Manager
2. Tools > Import/Restore configuration
3. Open the ini saved previously

It maybe better to do a clean up before import by go to Tools > Clean Up
